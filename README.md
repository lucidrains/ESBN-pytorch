## Emerging Symbol Binding Network (ESBN) - Pytorch (wip)

Usable implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14601">Emerging Symbol Binding Network</a> (ESBN), in Pytorch. They propose to have the main recurrent neural network interact with the input image representations only through a set of memory key / values.

The input image representation are cast as memory values, and are explicitly bound to memory keys that are generated by the network. The network generates the memory keys after getting a sum of all previous memory keys weighted by the similarity of the incoming representation to the set of memory values in storage.

This decoupling / indirection of sensory to abstract processing allows the network to outperform all previous approaches, including transformers.
